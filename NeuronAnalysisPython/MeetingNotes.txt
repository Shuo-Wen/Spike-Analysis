elpos-> It seemed that I wrote it before!
getAbove-> 
(1) RMSFit = fit(x,RMS','poly1') no corresponding equvlant of fit (numpy polyfit)
(2) slope_scalar = RMSFit.p1; p1??

isNotValid-> problem = max(pulsewidth(above, time, 'Polarity', 'Positive'))>limit || max(pulsewidth(above, time, 'Polarity', 'Positive'))==limit;

There's no pulsewidth in python

Neuron Analysis L169-174, 177- 186 normally python cannot assign empty array!
